            Coaching address your work performance and personal life issues. 
            A coach's role is to ask direct and powerful questions which will 
            help you to become more aware of who you are, what you want, and how 
            to get there. Coaching helps you to create action steps on your 
            insights and goals.

            Karin's approach to coaching is to ask powerful questions, 
            hear what you are unable to hear, and help you build a solid 
            action plan and set goals. Karin guides her clients as they take action 
            and holds them accountable to their goals. Most of Karin's coaching 
            sessions take place over the phone. She coaches clients no matter where they 
            are locaed.
